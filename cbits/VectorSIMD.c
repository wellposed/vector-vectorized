/*
for now i'm only going to do these operations for floats
and doubles

will add complex operations at some later point, but not for now

this code only provides SIMD on SSE3 through AVX supported platforms
for doubles and floats

+,  - , * , / ,  sqrt, 
abs  (mask with 9223372036854775807 for doubles, )
